What is NumPy?
Library: NumPy is a Python library.

Working with arrays: It provides support for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Stands for: Numerical Python.

Why use NumPy?
Faster than Python lists: NumPy arrays use less memory and are faster for numerical operations.

Efficient processing: It uses optimized C code under the hood, which makes operations like addition, multiplication, and matrix computation much faster.

Better tools: It provides many useful functions for linear algebra, statistics, and more.
