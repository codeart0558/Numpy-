What is NumPy?
Library: NumPy is a Python library.

Working with arrays: It provides support for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Stands for: Numerical Python.

Why use NumPy?
Faster than Python lists: NumPy arrays use less memory and are faster for numerical operations.

Efficient processing: It uses optimized C code under the hood, which makes operations like addition, multiplication, and matrix computation much faster.

Better tools: It provides many useful functions for linear algebra, statistics, and more.

If you're analyzing data stored in a CSV file, the usual process is:

First, use the pandas library to read the CSV file and convert it into a DataFrame. Pandas makes it easy to explore and clean your data.

Next, once your data is ready, you can convert the DataFrame into a NumPy array using .to_numpy() or .values.

Finally, you can use NumPy to perform fast mathematical operations on the data, such as calculating means, standard deviations, or doing matrix operations.
